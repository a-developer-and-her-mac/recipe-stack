# Recipe~Stack

Welcome to the repo of Recipe Stack! Recipe Stack is a simple little site that uses the
[free meal api](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php), to list a meal on a card. Click the
button underneath, and it generates a new meal. Recipe Stack is still a work in progress,
so it might not look like much right now, but slowly it's becoming better.
